description: This is a variation of `iam:CreatePolicyVersion` (iam-001). This variation
  is needed when you have `iam:CreatePolicyVersion` permission on a customer-managed
  policy that is attached to another role (not your own principal). In this scenario,
  you cannot directly escalate your own privileges, but you can escalate by modifying
  a policy attached to a different role and then assuming that role. This requires
  both `iam:CreatePolicyVersion` on a customer-managed policy AND `sts:AssumeRole`
  permission on a role that has that policy attached. Critically, the target role
  must also be configured with a trust policy that explicitly allows your principal
  to assume it. You create a new policy version with administrative permissions (setting
  it as default), then assume the role that has this policy attached to gain the elevated
  privileges. This exploits AWS's policy versioning feature where new versions take
  effect immediately for all principals that have the policy attached.
prerequisites:
  admin:
  - A customer-managed policy must exist that is attached to a target role
  - You must have `iam:CreatePolicyVersion` permission on that customer-managed policy
  - You must have `sts:AssumeRole` permission scoped to the target role
  - '**Critical**: The target role must have a trust policy that explicitly allows
    your principal to assume it (e.g., your user or role ARN must be in the Principal
    element of the role''s trust policy)'
  lateral:
  - A customer-managed policy must exist that is attached to a target role
  - You must have `iam:CreatePolicyVersion` permission on that customer-managed policy
  - You must have `sts:AssumeRole` permission scoped to the target role
  - '**Critical**: The target role must have a trust policy that explicitly allows
    your principal to assume it (e.g., your user or role ARN must be in the Principal
    element of the role''s trust policy)'

limitations: 'This path provides administrative access only if the new policy version
  includes administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess equivalent). The
  attacker gains whatever permissions are specified in the new policy version they
  create. However, even limited additional permissions may enable multi-hop attacks.

  '
recommendation: "This attack path requires multiple controls to prevent effectively:\n\
  \n**1. Restrict `iam:CreatePolicyVersion` permission:**\n- Very few principals need\
  \ this permission. Restrict it to only authorized IAM administrators.\n- Use resource-level\
  \ restrictions to limit which policies can be modified:\n```json\n{\n  \"Effect\"\
  : \"Allow\",\n  \"Action\": \"iam:CreatePolicyVersion\",\n  \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:policy/AllowedPolicy*\"\
  \n}\n```\n\n**2. Restrict `sts:AssumeRole` permission:**\n- Carefully audit IAM\
  \ role trust policies to ensure they follow the principle of least privilege.\n\
  - Only allow trusted principals to assume sensitive roles.\n- Consider requiring\
  \ MFA for sensitive role assumptions:\n```json\n{\n  \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n  \"\
  Principal\": {\"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:user/TrustedUser\"},\n  \"Action\"\
  : \"sts:AssumeRole\",\n  \"Condition\": {\"Bool\": {\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\"\
  : \"true\"}}\n}\n```\n\n**3. Monitoring and Detection:**\n- Alert on `CreatePolicyVersion`\
  \ events in CloudTrail, especially with `--set-as-default` flag\n- Monitor for `AssumeRole`\
  \ events on privileged roles, especially shortly after policy version changes\n\
  - Use AWS Config rules to detect roles with administrative permissions that can\
  \ be assumed by users\n- Implement anomaly detection for unusual assume-role patterns\
  \ or assumptions from unexpected IP addresses\n\n**4. Additional Controls:**\n-\
  \ Use IAM Access Analyzer to regularly audit role trust policies for overly permissive\
  \ trust relationships\n- Implement service control policies (SCPs) to restrict policy\
  \ version creation at the organizational level\n- Consider using permission boundaries\
  \ to limit the maximum permissions that can be granted through policy modifications\n"
