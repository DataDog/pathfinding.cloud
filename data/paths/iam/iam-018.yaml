description: This is a variation of `iam:PutUserPolicy` (iam-007). This variation is needed when you have `iam:PutUserPolicy` permission on another user (not your own principal). In this scenario, you cannot directly escalate your own privileges, but you can escalate by modifying a different user and then authenticating as that user. Since the target is a user (not a role), you need `iam:CreateAccessKey` to create credentials for authentication, rather than using `sts:AssumeRole`. You add an inline policy with administrative permissions directly to the target user, create new access keys for that user, and then authenticate using those credentials to gain the elevated privileges. Unlike managed policy attachment, inline policies are embedded directly in the user object, making them less visible in some security reviews and IAM policy management tools.

prerequisites:
  admin:
  - "A target IAM user must exist that you have `iam:PutUserPolicy` permission on"
  - "You must have `iam:CreateAccessKey` permission scoped to the target user"
  - "The target user must have fewer than 2 access keys (AWS enforces a limit of 2 access keys per IAM user)"
  lateral:
  - "A target IAM user must exist that you have `iam:PutUserPolicy` permission on"
  - "You must have `iam:CreateAccessKey` permission scoped to the target user"

limitations: |
  The attack provides administrative access because the attacker controls the inline policy document content. Unlike iam:AttachUserPolicy (which requires choosing from existing managed policies), iam:PutUserPolicy allows the attacker to embed any policy document directly into the user, guaranteeing administrative permissions regardless of what policies exist in the environment.

recommendation: |
  Restrict `iam:PutUserPolicy` and `iam:CreateAccessKey` using the principle of least privilege. These permissions should rarely be granted together on the same target user, as this combination creates a direct privilege escalation path.

  **Prevention strategies:**

  1. Restrict `iam:PutUserPolicy` to prevent cross-user inline policy modification:
  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "iam:PutUserPolicy",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:user/${aws:username}",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "iam:UserName": "${aws:username}"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  2. Restrict `iam:CreateAccessKey` to prevent cross-user access key creation:
  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "iam:CreateAccessKey",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:user/${aws:username}",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "iam:UserName": "${aws:username}"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  3. Use IAM permissions boundaries to limit the maximum permissions a user can have, even if administrative inline policies are added

  4. Separate the permissions - avoid granting both `iam:PutUserPolicy` and `iam:CreateAccessKey` to the same principal for other users

  5. Require MFA for sensitive inline policy operations and access key creation

  6. Implement regular audits of inline policies, as they can be less visible than managed policies in standard IAM reviews

  7. Use Service Control Policies (SCPs) to prevent the addition of overly permissive inline policies

  **Detection strategies:**

  Monitor CloudTrail for the following event patterns:
  - `PutUserPolicy` API calls where the calling principal differs from the target user
  - `CreateAccessKey` API calls where the calling principal differs from the target user
  - Sequential occurrences of `PutUserPolicy` followed by `CreateAccessKey` on the same user within a short time window
  - `PutUserPolicy` events with policy documents containing broad permissions (e.g., `"Action": "*"` or `"Action": "iam:*"`)
  - Access key creation events that follow inline policy modification events

  Set up CloudWatch alarms for unexpected changes to inline user policies and creation of access keys by non-self principals. Investigate any modifications to user inline policies combined with access key creation. Consider implementing automated responses to roll back suspicious inline policy changes.

attackVisualization:
  nodes:
  - id: start
    label: Starting Principal
    type: principal
    description: |
      The principal initiating the attack. Can be an IAM user or role with both `iam:PutUserPolicy` and `iam:CreateAccessKey` permissions on the target user. This principal may have minimal or no administrative permissions initially, but the combination of these two permissions creates a complete privilege escalation path.

  - id: target_user
    label: Existing target-user
    type: principal
    description: |
      The IAM user being modified and compromised. Must be a valid IAM user with fewer than 2 existing access keys. Initially, this user may have minimal or no privileges. The attacker will create an inline policy granting administrative permissions and then create new access keys for authentication.

  - id: admin
    label: Effective Administrator
    type: outcome
    description: |
      Full administrative access to the AWS account. The attacker achieves this by first using `iam:PutUserPolicy` to create an inline policy on the target user with administrative permissions, then using `iam:CreateAccessKey` to create new access keys for authentication. This is a deterministic outcome since the attacker controls the policy document content and can grant themselves any permissions they choose.

  edges:
  - from: start
    to: target_user
    label: iam:PutUserPolicy
    description: |
      The attacker uses `iam:PutUserPolicy` to create or update an inline policy on the target user, granting administrative permissions.

      Command:
      ```bash
      aws iam put-user-policy \
        --user-name target-user-name \
        --policy-name AdminPolicy \
        --policy-document '{"Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":[{"Effect":"Allow","Action":"*","Resource":"*"}]}'
      ```

      After this action, the target user has administrative permissions via an inline policy. The attacker must wait approximately 15 seconds for the IAM policy changes to propagate across AWS infrastructure.

  - from: target_user
    to: admin
    label: iam:CreateAccessKey + Authenticate
    description: |
      The attacker uses `iam:CreateAccessKey` to create new access keys for the now-privileged target user, then authenticates using those credentials.

      Commands:
      ```bash
      # Create access keys
      CREDENTIALS=$(aws iam create-access-key \
        --user-name target-user-name \
        --output json)

      NEW_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(echo $CREDENTIALS | jq -r '.AccessKey.AccessKeyId')
      NEW_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(echo $CREDENTIALS | jq -r '.AccessKey.SecretAccessKey')

      # Configure profile with new credentials
      aws configure set aws_access_key_id $NEW_ACCESS_KEY_ID --profile compromised
      aws configure set aws_secret_access_key $NEW_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY --profile compromised

      # Use the compromised credentials
      aws iam list-users --profile compromised
      ```

      These new access keys have full administrative permissions and can be used to perform any action in the AWS account. Unlike temporary credentials from AssumeRole, these access keys do not expire and remain valid until explicitly deactivated or deleted.
