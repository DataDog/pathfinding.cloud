description: This is a variation of `iam:AttachRolePolicy` (iam-009). This variation
  is needed when you have `iam:AttachRolePolicy` permission on another role (not your
  own principal). In this scenario, you cannot directly escalate your own privileges,
  but you can escalate by modifying a different role and then assuming it. This requires
  both `iam:AttachRolePolicy` on the target role AND `sts:AssumeRole` permission.
  Critically, the target role must also be configured with a trust policy that explicitly
  allows your principal to assume it. You attach an administrative policy to the target
  role, then assume that role to gain the elevated privileges. Even if the target
  role initially has minimal or no privileges, this combination creates a complete
  privilege escalation path to administrative access.
prerequisites:
  admin:
  - A target role must exist that you have `iam:AttachRolePolicy` permission on
  - You must have `sts:AssumeRole` permission scoped to the target role
  - '**Critical**: The target role must have a trust policy that explicitly allows
    your principal to assume it (e.g., your user or role ARN must be in the Principal
    element of the role''s trust policy)'
  - The starting principal must have both permissions (iam:AttachRolePolicy AND sts:AssumeRole)
    scoped to the same target role
  - An AWS-managed or customer-managed policy with administrative permissions must
    exist that you can attach (e.g., AdministratorAccess)
  lateral:
  - A target role must exist that you have `iam:AttachRolePolicy` permission on
  - You must have `sts:AssumeRole` permission scoped to the target role
  - '**Critical**: The target role must have a trust policy that explicitly allows
    your principal to assume it (e.g., your user or role ARN must be in the Principal
    element of the role''s trust policy)'
  - The starting principal must have both permissions (iam:AttachRolePolicy AND sts:AssumeRole)
    scoped to the same target role

limitations: 'The attack provides administrative access only if an admin policy (like
  AdministratorAccess) is attached to the role. However, the attacker could attach
  any AWS-managed or customer-managed policy they have visibility into, so the level
  of access depends on available policies.

  '
recommendation: "Restrict `iam:AttachRolePolicy` and `sts:AssumeRole` using the principle\
  \ of least privilege. These permissions should rarely be granted together on the\
  \ same target role.\n\n**Prevention strategies:**\n\n1. Use IAM policy conditions\
  \ to restrict which policies can be attached:\n```json\n{\n  \"Effect\": \"Allow\"\
  ,\n  \"Action\": \"iam:AttachRolePolicy\",\n  \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/SpecificRole\"\
  ,\n  \"Condition\": {\n    \"ArnNotEquals\": {\n      \"iam:PolicyARN\": [\n   \
  \     \"arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess\",\n        \"arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/PowerUserAccess\"\
  \n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. Implement Service Control Policies (SCPs) to\
  \ prevent attachment of highly privileged managed policies\n\n3. Use IAM permissions\
  \ boundaries to limit the maximum permissions a role can have, even if admin policies\
  \ are attached\n\n4. Separate the permissions - avoid granting both `iam:AttachRolePolicy`\
  \ and `sts:AssumeRole` to the same principal for the same role\n\n5. Require MFA\
  \ for both policy attachment operations and role assumption\n\n**Detection strategies:**\n\
  \nMonitor CloudTrail for the following event patterns:\n- `AttachRolePolicy` API\
  \ calls, especially when followed by `AssumeRole` on the same resource within a\
  \ short time window\n- Attachment of AWS-managed policies like `AdministratorAccess`\
  \ or `PowerUserAccess` to roles\n- Role assumption events (`AssumeRole`) that follow\
  \ policy modification events\n\nSet up CloudWatch alarms for unexpected changes\
  \ to role policies and investigate any modifications to role permissions.\n"
