description: A principal with `iam:AttachRolePolicy` and `sts:AssumeRole` permissions on the same target role can achieve privilege escalation by attaching an administrative policy (such as the AWS-managed AdministratorAccess policy) to the role, then assuming that role to gain elevated privileges. This is a lateral movement attack where the attacker modifies a different principal's permissions and then assumes that principal's identity. Even if the target role initially has minimal or no privileges, the combination of these two permissions creates a complete privilege escalation path to administrative access.

prerequisites:
  admin:
    - "A role must exist that the starting principal has permission to attach policies to"
    - "The role must have a trust policy that allows the starting principal to assume it"
    - "The starting principal must have iam:AttachRolePolicy permission scoped to the target role"
    - "The starting principal must have sts:AssumeRole permission scoped to the target role"
  lateral:
    - "A role must exist that the starting principal has permission to attach policies to"
    - "The role must have a trust policy that allows the starting principal to assume it"
    - "The starting principal must have iam:AttachRolePolicy permission scoped to the target role"
    - "The starting principal must have sts:AssumeRole permission scoped to the target role"

limitations: |
  This attack requires that the target role has a trust policy allowing the starting principal to assume it. The attack provides administrative access only if an admin policy (like AdministratorAccess) is attached to the role. However, the attacker could attach any AWS-managed or customer-managed policy they have visibility into, so the level of access depends on available policies.

  Additionally, the starting principal must have both permissions (iam:AttachRolePolicy AND sts:AssumeRole) scoped to the same target role. If these permissions are scoped to different roles, the attack path is not viable.

recommendation: |
  Restrict `iam:AttachRolePolicy` and `sts:AssumeRole` using the principle of least privilege. These permissions should rarely be granted together on the same target role.

  **Prevention strategies:**

  1. Use IAM policy conditions to restrict which policies can be attached:
  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/SpecificRole",
    "Condition": {
      "ArnNotEquals": {
        "iam:PolicyARN": [
          "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess",
          "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/PowerUserAccess"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  2. Implement Service Control Policies (SCPs) to prevent attachment of highly privileged managed policies

  3. Use IAM permissions boundaries to limit the maximum permissions a role can have, even if admin policies are attached

  4. Separate the permissions - avoid granting both `iam:AttachRolePolicy` and `sts:AssumeRole` to the same principal for the same role

  5. Require MFA for both policy attachment operations and role assumption

  **Detection strategies:**

  Monitor CloudTrail for the following event patterns:
  - `AttachRolePolicy` API calls, especially when followed by `AssumeRole` on the same resource within a short time window
  - Attachment of AWS-managed policies like `AdministratorAccess` or `PowerUserAccess` to roles
  - Role assumption events (`AssumeRole`) that follow policy modification events

  Set up CloudWatch alarms for unexpected changes to role policies and investigate any modifications to role permissions.

      description: |
        The principal initiating the attack. Can be an IAM user or role with both `iam:AttachRolePolicy` and `sts:AssumeRole` permissions on the target role.

        This principal may have minimal or no administrative permissions initially, but the combination of these two permissions creates a complete privilege escalation path.

    - id: target_role

      type: resource
      description: |
        The IAM role being modified and assumed. Must have a trust policy that allows the starting principal to assume it.

        Initially, this role may have minimal or no privileges. The attacker will attach the AdministratorAccess policy to it.

    - id: admin
      label: Effective Administrator
      type: outcome
      description: |
        Full administrative access to the AWS account. The attacker achieves this by:
        1. Attaching AdministratorAccess policy to the target role
        2. Assuming the target role to obtain temporary credentials
        3. Using those credentials to perform administrative actions

        This is a deterministic outcome since the attacker controls which policy to attach to the role.

  edges:
    - from: start
      to: target_role
      label: iam:AttachRolePolicy (AdministratorAccess)
      description: |
        The attacker uses `iam:AttachRolePolicy` to attach the AWS-managed AdministratorAccess policy to the target role.

        Command:
        ```bash
        aws iam attach-role-policy \
          --role-name target-role-name \
          --policy-arn "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess"
        ```

        After this action, the target role has administrative permissions. The attacker must wait approximately 15 seconds for the IAM policy changes to propagate across AWS infrastructure.

    - from: target_role
      to: admin
      label: sts:AssumeRole
      description: |
        The attacker uses `sts:AssumeRole` to assume the now-privileged target role and obtain temporary credentials.

        Command:
        ```bash
        CREDENTIALS=$(aws sts assume-role \
          --role-arn "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/target-role-name" \
          --role-session-name privesc-session \
          --query 'Credentials' \
          --output json)

        export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(echo $CREDENTIALS | jq -r '.AccessKeyId')
        export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(echo $CREDENTIALS | jq -r '.SecretAccessKey')
        export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=$(echo $CREDENTIALS | jq -r '.SessionToken')
        ```

        These temporary credentials have full administrative permissions and can be used to perform any action in the AWS account.
