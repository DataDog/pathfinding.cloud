description: Anyone with access to `iam:PutUserPolicy` can attach inline policies
  to any user they have this permission on. This permission is frequently exploited
  by a principal to grant themselves additional privileges. A principal can also leverage
  this to escalate the permissions of another principal they can access.
prerequisites:
- Principal must be a user (not a role)
exploitationSteps:
  awscli:
  - step: 1
    command: aws iam put-user-policy --user-name @username --policy-name @policyname
      --policy-document file://escalation_policy.json
    description: Attach an inline policy with elevated permissions to the target user
  - step: 2
    command: aws sts get-caller-identity
    description: Verify the new permissions are active (for self-escalation)
recommendation: 'Restrict access to `iam:PutUserPolicy` using the principle of least
  privilege. Very few

  principals need this permission, so it should be restricted to only the few principals

  that need it. Monitor use of this sensitive permission using CloudSIEM detections,

  and look for usage anomalies.

  '
limitations: 'This path provides administrative access because the attacker controls
  the policy document content. The attacker can embed any permissions directly into
  the principal, guaranteeing administrative access regardless of what policies exist
  in the environment. However, even limited additional permissions may enable multi-hop
  attacks.
