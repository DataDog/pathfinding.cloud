description: Anyone with access to `iam:AttachGroupPolicy` can attach managed policies
  to any group they have this permission on. This permission is frequently exploited
  by a principal to grant themselves additional privileges by attaching policies to
  a group they are a member of. A principal can also leverage this to escalate the
  permissions of other principals in the same group.
prerequisites:
- Principal must be a user (not a role)
- Principal must be a member of the target group
- A managed IAM policy with elevated privileges must exist in the account
exploitationSteps:
  awscli:
  - step: 1
    command: aws iam attach-group-policy --group-name @groupname --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess
    description: Attach the AdministratorAccess managed policy to the group
  - step: 2
    command: aws sts get-caller-identity
    description: Verify the new permissions are active
recommendation: 'Restrict access to `iam:AttachGroupPolicy` using the principle of
  least privilege. Very few

  principals need this permission, so it should be restricted to only the few principals

  that need it. Monitor use of this sensitive permission using CloudSIEM detections,

  and look for usage anomalies.

  '
limitations: 'This path provides administrative access only if an administrative managed
  policy (e.g., AdministratorAccess) exists in the AWS account. If only limited managed
  policies are available, the attacker gains access limited to those permissions.
  However, even limited privilege escalation may enable multi-hop attacks or access
  to sensitive data.

    resourceConstraints: Target group must be in the Resource section. For self-escalation,
      must have permission on a group the principal belongs to.
