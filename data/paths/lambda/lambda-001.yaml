description: A principal with `iam:PassRole`, `lambda:CreateFunction`, and `lambda:InvokeFunction`
  can create a new Lambda function and attach an existing IAM Role to it. When the
  function is invoked, the code executes with the permissions of the attached role.
  The level of access gained depends on the permissions of the available roles.
prerequisites:
  admin:
  - A role must exist that trusts lambda.amazonaws.com to assume it
  - The role must have administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess)
  lateral:
  - A role must exist that trusts lambda.amazonaws.com to assume it

recommendation: "High powered service roles + overly permissive `iam:PassRole` is\
  \ what makes this privilege escalation path exploitable and impactful.\n\n- **Avoid\
  \ administrative service roles** - Very rarely does a Lambda function need administrative\
  \ access. Use the principle of least privilege.\n- **Avoid granting `iam:PassRole`\
  \ on all resources** - Whenever possible, restrict `iam:PassRole` to specific roles\
  \ or specific services.\nUse IAM policy conditions to restrict which roles can be\
  \ passed and to which services:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n  \"Action\"\
  : \"iam:PassRole\",\n  \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/SpecificLambdaRole\"\
  ,\n  \"Condition\": {\n    \"StringEquals\": {\n      \"iam:PassedToService\": \"\
  lambda.amazonaws.com\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n- Monitor CloudTrail for unusual\
  \ Lambda function creation followed by immediate invocation\n- Monitor CloudTrail\
  \ for Lambda function creation by principals who do not usually create functions\n\
  - Monitor CloudTrail for roles being passed to Lambda that haven't been used before\n\
  - Monitor and alert on Lambda function creation with privileged roles\n- Regularly\
  \ audit Lambda functions for excessive IAM permissions\n- Regularly audit all IAM\
  \ roles that trust the Lambda service and down-scope any roles with administrative\
  \ access\n"
limitations: 'This path provides administrative access only if the passed role has
  administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess or an equivalent custom policy).
  If only limited roles are available, you gain access limited to those permissions.
  However, even limited access may enable multi-hop attacks or access to sensitive
  data.
