description: A principal with `lambda:UpdateFunctionCode` and `lambda:AddPermission` can modify an existing Lambda function's code with malicious code and grant themselves permission to invoke it via the resource-based policy. The attacker does not need `lambda:InvokeFunction` as an IAM permission because `lambda:AddPermission` grants invocation rights through the function's resource-based policy. This allows the attacker to execute the malicious code under the function's privileged execution role immediately, without waiting for automatic triggers.
prerequisites:
  admin:
  - A Lambda function must exist with an administrative execution role (e.g., AdministratorAccess)

recommendation: |
  Restrict `lambda:UpdateFunctionCode`, `lambda:AddPermission`, and `lambda:InvokeFunction` permissions using the principle of least privilege. These permissions should be limited to specific Lambda function resources:

  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "lambda:UpdateFunctionCode",
      "lambda:AddPermission",
      "lambda:InvokeFunction"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:function/SpecificFunction"
  }
  ```

  Additional security controls:
  - Implement Lambda code signing to prevent unauthorized code modifications
  - Lambda execution roles should follow least privilege and never have AdministratorAccess
  - Use AWS Config rules to detect Lambda functions with overly permissive execution roles
  - Monitor CloudTrail for `UpdateFunctionCode`, `AddPermission`, and `InvokeFunction` events on sensitive functions
  - Implement SCPs to prevent modification of Lambda functions with privileged roles
  - Use IAM Access Analyzer to identify privilege escalation paths involving Lambda permissions
  - Protect resource-based policies by denying `lambda:AddPermission` except for trusted CI/CD roles
  - Enable CloudWatch alarms for unusual Lambda invocation patterns on privileged functions
limitations: |
  This path provides administrative access only if the target Lambda function's execution role has administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess or equivalent custom policies). If the execution role has limited permissions, you gain access limited to those permissions. However, even limited execution role access may enable multi-hop attacks or access to sensitive data stores.
