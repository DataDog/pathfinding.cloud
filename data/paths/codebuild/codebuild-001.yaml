description: A principal with `iam:PassRole`, `codebuild:CreateProject`, and `codebuild:StartBuild` can create a new CodeBuild project and attach an existing privileged IAM role to it. By starting a build with a malicious buildspec, the attacker can execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the attached role, allowing privilege escalation. This is a classic "pass role to service" privilege escalation pattern where the combination of service creation, role passing, and execution permissions creates an indirect path to elevated privileges. The level of access gained depends on the permissions of the available roles.
prerequisites:
  admin:
  - A role must exist that trusts codebuild.amazonaws.com to assume it
  - The role must have administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess or an equivalent custom policy)
  lateral:
  - A role must exist that trusts codebuild.amazonaws.com to assume it

limitations: |
  This path provides administrative access only if the passed role has administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess or an equivalent custom policy). If only limited roles are available, you gain access limited to those permissions. However, even limited access may enable multi-hop attacks.

  This attack requires:
  1. The ability to create CodeBuild projects (`codebuild:CreateProject`)
  2. The ability to start builds (`codebuild:StartBuild`)
  3. The ability to pass a role to CodeBuild service (`iam:PassRole`)
  4. A role that trusts codebuild.amazonaws.com
recommendation: |
  Restrict `iam:PassRole` using the principle of least privilege. Use IAM policy conditions to limit which roles can be passed and to which services:

  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "iam:PassRole",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/SpecificCodeBuildRole",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "iam:PassedToService": "codebuild.amazonaws.com"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Additional controls:
  - **Separate Permissions**: Avoid granting `codebuild:CreateProject` and `iam:PassRole` to the same principal
  - **Restrict CodeBuild Project Creation**: Limit `codebuild:CreateProject` to specific project name patterns or require approval workflows
  - **Service Role Controls**: Ensure CodeBuild service roles follow least privilege and cannot modify IAM permissions
  - **Monitor CloudTrail**: Alert on `CreateProject` API calls where privileged roles are being passed, and monitor `StartBuild` executions
  - **Monitor IAM Changes**: Alert on `AttachUserPolicy`, `PutUserPolicy`, `AttachRolePolicy`, and `PutRolePolicy` calls from CodeBuild service principals
  - **Service Control Policies**: Implement SCPs to prevent CodeBuild service roles from modifying IAM policies
  - **IAM Access Analyzer**: Use AWS IAM Access Analyzer to identify privilege escalation paths involving CodeBuild and PassRole
  - **Require Source Control**: Configure organizational policies to require buildspecs from source control repositories rather than inline definitions
  - **Role Trust Policies**: Review roles that trust codebuild.amazonaws.com and ensure they follow least privilege

    description: |
      The starting principal (user or role) with `iam:PassRole`, `codebuild:CreateProject`, and `codebuild:StartBuild` permissions. This principal will create a CodeBuild project with a privileged role attached and start a build to execute code with elevated privileges.

      The newly created CodeBuild project with a malicious buildspec. The project is created with `codebuild:CreateProject` and configured to use a privileged IAM role via `iam:PassRole`. The buildspec contains commands that will execute when the build starts, designed to grant the starting principal administrative access or perform privileged actions.

      The privileged IAM role that is passed to the CodeBuild project during creation. This role must trust codebuild.amazonaws.com as a principal in its trust policy. When the build executes, the CodeBuild environment automatically assumes this role and all buildspec commands run with this role's permissions.

      When the build starts, the CodeBuild environment assumes the target role and executes the buildspec commands with the role's permissions. The buildspec can perform various privileged actions such as attaching AdministratorAccess to the starting principal, creating new access keys, modifying IAM policies, or accessing sensitive data.

      If the target role has administrative permissions (AdministratorAccess or equivalent) or permissions to modify IAM policies (like `iam:AttachUserPolicy`, `iam:PutUserPolicy`, `iam:CreateAccessKey`), the buildspec successfully elevates the starting principal to administrator. The starting principal now has full administrative access to the AWS account.

    description: |
      If the target role has some elevated permissions but not full admin or IAM write permissions, the buildspec can perform some privileged actions. This could include access to sensitive data (S3, RDS, DynamoDB) or the ability to pursue additional escalation paths. The level of additional access depends on the specific permissions of the target role.

      If the target role only has minimal permissions or permissions limited to logging/metrics, the buildspec execution may not provide meaningful privilege escalation. However, even limited access could be useful for reconnaissance or as part of a multi-step attack chain.

    description: |
      The attacker creates a new CodeBuild project and passes a privileged role to it. The project is created with a malicious inline buildspec that will execute commands to escalate privileges.

      Command:
      ```bash
      aws codebuild create-project --name privesc-project \
        --source type=NO_SOURCE,buildspec="version: 0.2\nphases:\n  build:\n    commands:\n      - aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name YOUR_USERNAME --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess" \

        --service-role arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/PRIVILEGED_ROLE
      ```

      The buildspec contains commands to attach AdministratorAccess to the starting principal or perform other privileged actions.
  - from: codebuild_project
    to: target_role
    label: Project assumes role
    description: |
      When the CodeBuild build is started, the CodeBuild service automatically assumes the target role on behalf of the build environment. All buildspec commands then execute with the permissions granted to this role.
  - from: target_role
    to: execute_buildspec
    label: codebuild:StartBuild
    description: |
      The attacker starts the build, which triggers execution of the buildspec commands with the target role's permissions. The build environment has full AWS SDK access and can make any API calls allowed by the role.

      Command:
      ```bash
      aws codebuild start-build --project-name privesc-project
      ```

      The buildspec commands execute automatically when the build starts. Monitor with `aws codebuild batch-get-builds --ids BUILD_ID` to track execution.

      If the target role has AdministratorAccess or permissions to modify IAM (like `iam:AttachUserPolicy`, `iam:PutUserPolicy`, `iam:AddUserToGroup`, `iam:CreateAccessKey`), the buildspec successfully elevates the starting principal to administrator. The starting principal gains full control over the AWS account.

      If the target role has elevated permissions but not full admin or IAM write access, the buildspec can perform some privileged actions. This might include access to sensitive data stores (S3 buckets, RDS databases, DynamoDB tables) or permissions that enable additional privilege escalation techniques through multi-hop attacks.

      If the target role only has minimal or non-sensitive permissions (like logs:CreateLogGroup, logs:PutLogEvents), the privilege escalation may not yield meaningful additional access. However, even limited access could be useful for reconnaissance or understanding the environment's configuration.
