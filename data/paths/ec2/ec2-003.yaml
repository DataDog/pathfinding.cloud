description: A principal with `iam:PassRole` and `ec2:RequestSpotInstances` permissions
  can escalate privileges by requesting an EC2 Spot Instance with a privileged IAM
  instance profile. The Spot Instance launches with the privileged role's credentials,
  which can then be used to execute commands (via user-data scripts) that grant additional
  permissions to the starting principal. This technique is functionally identical
  to the standard `ec2:RunInstances` privilege escalation path, but uses Spot Instances
  instead. Security teams must understand that restricting `ec2:RunInstances` alone
  is insufficient - they must also restrict `ec2:RequestSpotInstances` to prevent
  the same attack vector. EC2 Spot Instances are spare compute capacity available
  at significantly discounted rates (up to 90% off On-Demand prices), making them
  particularly attractive for attackers executing privilege escalation while minimizing
  costs.
prerequisites:
  admin:
  - A role must exist that trusts ec2.amazonaws.com to assume it
  - The role must have administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess or an
    equivalent custom policy)
  - The role must have an instance profile associated with it
  - A VPC and subnet must be available for launching the Spot Instance

limitations: 'This path provides administrative access only if the passed role has
  administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess policy). If only limited roles
  are available, you gain access limited to those permissions. However, even limited
  access may enable multi-hop attacks or provide access to sensitive data.

  '
recommendation: "High powered service roles + overly permissive `iam:PassRole` is\
  \ what makes this privilege escalation path exploitable and impactful.\n\n- **Avoid\
  \ administrative service roles** - Very rarely does an EC2 Spot Instance need administrative\
  \ access. Use the principle of least privilege.\n- **Avoid granting `iam:PassRole`\
  \ on all resources** - Whenever possible, restrict `iam:PassRole` to specific roles\
  \ or specific services.\n\nUse IAM policy conditions to restrict which roles can\
  \ be passed and to which services:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n  \"\
  Action\": \"iam:PassRole\",\n  \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/SpecificEC2Role\"\
  ,\n  \"Condition\": {\n    \"StringEquals\": {\n      \"iam:PassedToService\": \"\
  ec2.amazonaws.com\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- Apply the same security controls to\
  \ `ec2:RequestSpotInstances` as you would to `ec2:RunInstances` - both provide equivalent\
  \ privilege escalation paths\n- Monitor CloudTrail for unusual EC2 Spot Instance\
  \ requests followed by immediate access\n- Monitor CloudTrail for Spot Instance\
  \ launches by principals who do not usually create instances\n- Monitor CloudTrail\
  \ for roles being passed to EC2 Spot Instances that haven't been used before\n-\
  \ Monitor and alert on EC2 Spot Instance creation with privileged roles\n- Regularly\
  \ audit EC2 instances (including Spot Instances) for excessive IAM permissions\n\
  - Regularly audit all IAM roles that trust the EC2 service and down-scope any roles\
  \ with administrative access\n"
