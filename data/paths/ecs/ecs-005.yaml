description: A principal with `iam:PassRole`, `ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition`, and `ecs:StartTask` can create a new ECS task definition and attach an existing privileged IAM role to it, then start the task on an existing EC2 container instance. By registering a task definition with a malicious container command and starting it on an EC2-based ECS cluster, the attacker can execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the attached role, allowing privilege escalation. Unlike `ecs:RunTask` which works with both EC2 and Fargate launch types, `ecs:StartTask` is specifically for EC2 launch types and requires specifying an existing container instance ARN. This is a classic "pass role to service" privilege escalation pattern where the combination of task definition registration, role passing, and task execution permissions creates an indirect path to elevated privileges. The level of access gained depends on the permissions of the available roles.
prerequisites:
  admin:
  - An ECS cluster must exist with at least one registered EC2 container instance
  - A role must exist that trusts ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com to assume it
  - The role must have administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess or an equivalent custom policy)
  lateral:
  - An ECS cluster must exist with at least one registered EC2 container instance
  - A role must exist that trusts ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com to assume it

limitations: |
  This path provides administrative access only if the passed role has administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess or an equivalent custom policy). If only limited roles are available, you gain access limited to those permissions. However, even limited access may enable multi-hop attacks.

  This attack requires:
  1. The ability to register task definitions (`ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition`)
  2. The ability to start tasks on existing container instances (`ecs:StartTask`)
  3. The ability to pass a role to ECS tasks service (`iam:PassRole`)
  4. An ECS cluster with at least one registered EC2 container instance
  5. A role that trusts ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com

  Note: `ecs:StartTask` is specifically for EC2 launch types and requires specifying an existing container instance ARN. This differs from `ecs:RunTask`, which works with both EC2 and Fargate launch types and can automatically select placement.
recommendation: |
  Restrict `iam:PassRole` using the principle of least privilege. Use IAM policy conditions to limit which roles can be passed and to which services:

  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "iam:PassRole",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/SpecificECSTaskRole",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "iam:PassedToService": "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Additional controls:
  - **Separate Permissions**: Avoid granting `ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition`, `ecs:StartTask`, and `iam:PassRole` to the same principal
  - **Restrict Task Definition Registration**: Limit `ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition` to specific task definition family patterns or require approval workflows
  - **Service Role Controls**: Ensure ECS task roles follow least privilege and cannot modify IAM permissions
  - **Monitor CloudTrail**: Alert on `RegisterTaskDefinition` API calls where privileged roles are being passed, and monitor `StartTask` executions
  - **Monitor IAM Changes**: Alert on `AttachUserPolicy`, `PutUserPolicy`, `AttachRolePolicy`, and `PutRolePolicy` calls from ECS task service principals
  - **Service Control Policies**: Implement SCPs to prevent ECS task roles from modifying IAM policies
  - **IAM Access Analyzer**: Use AWS IAM Access Analyzer to identify privilege escalation paths involving ECS and PassRole
  - **Task Definition Review**: Review task definitions for suspicious container commands or entry points
  - **Role Trust Policies**: Review roles that trust ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com and ensure they follow least privilege
  - **Container Instance Access**: Restrict access to EC2 container instances and monitor for suspicious task executions
