description: A principal with `iam:PassRole` and `glue:CreateDevEndpoint` can create
  a new Glue development endpoint and attach an existing IAM role to it. Glue dev
  endpoints provide SSH/Zeppelin notebook access where arbitrary code can be executed
  with the permissions of the attached role. The level of access gained depends on
  the permissions of the available roles.
prerequisites:
  admin:
  - A role must exist that trusts glue.amazonaws.com to assume it
  - The role must have administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess)
  lateral:
  - A role must exist that trusts glue.amazonaws.com to assume it

    command: "aws glue create-dev-endpoint --endpoint-name privesc-endpoint \\\n \
      \ --role-arn arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/PRIVILEGED_ROLE \\\n  --public-key\
      \ \"$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)\"\n"

    description: SSH into the dev endpoint and execute code with elevated privileges
recommendation: "High powered service roles + overly permissive `iam:PassRole` is\
  \ what makes this privilege escalation path exploitable and impactful.\n\n- **Avoid\
  \ administrative service roles** - Very rarely does a Glue dev endpoint need administrative\
  \ access. Use the principle of least privilege.\n- **Avoid granting `iam:PassRole`\
  \ on all resources** - Whenever possible, restrict `iam:PassRole` to specific roles\
  \ or specific services.\n\nUse IAM policy conditions to restrict which roles can\
  \ be passed and to which services:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n  \"\
  Action\": \"iam:PassRole\",\n  \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/SpecificGlueRole\"\
  ,\n  \"Condition\": {\n    \"StringEquals\": {\n      \"iam:PassedToService\": \"\
  glue.amazonaws.com\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- Monitor CloudTrail for unusual Glue\
  \ dev endpoint creation followed by immediate access\n- Monitor CloudTrail for dev\
  \ endpoint creation by principals who do not usually create endpoints\n- Monitor\
  \ CloudTrail for roles being passed to Glue that haven't been used before\n- Monitor\
  \ and alert on Glue dev endpoint creation with privileged roles\n- Regularly audit\
  \ Glue dev endpoints for excessive IAM permissions\n- Regularly audit all IAM roles\
  \ that trust the Glue service and down-scope any roles with administrative access\n"
limitations: 'This path provides administrative access only if the passed role has
  administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess or an equivalent custom policy).
  If only limited roles are available, you gain access limited to those permissions.
  However, even limited access may enable multi-hop attacks or access to sensitive
  data.
