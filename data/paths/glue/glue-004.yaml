description: A principal with `iam:PassRole`, `glue:CreateJob`, and `glue:CreateTrigger` can create an AWS Glue job with a privileged IAM role and establish a scheduled trigger that automatically executes the job. Unlike manual execution via `glue:StartJobRun`, this technique creates a persistent attack mechanism through scheduled automation. AWS Glue triggers are automation components that can start jobs based on schedules (cron expressions), events, or on-demand. When a trigger is created with the `--start-on-creation` flag, it immediately activates and begins executing the associated job according to its schedule (e.g., every minute). The trigger-based approach is particularly dangerous because it demonstrates a persistence pattern rather than just immediate exploitation. The attacker creates a scheduled job that continuously grants administrative access, making it harder to detect and remediate. This technique shows how AWS service automation features can be abused for persistent privilege escalation. The job executes Python code that modifies IAM permissions to grant the starting principal administrative access, and the trigger ensures this runs repeatedly on a schedule.

prerequisites:
  admin:
    - "A role must exist that trusts glue.amazonaws.com to assume it"
    - "The role must have administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess or an equivalent custom policy)"
  lateral:
    - "A role must exist that trusts glue.amazonaws.com to assume it"
    - "The role's permissions determine the level of access gained"

limitations: |
  This path provides administrative access only if the passed role has administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess policy). If only limited roles are available in the environment, you gain access limited to those role's permissions. However, even limited access may enable multi-hop attacks or access to sensitive data. The level of access depends entirely on the permissions of the role that can be passed to the Glue service. The persistent nature of triggers means access can be re-granted even after remediation attempts if the trigger is not identified and removed.

recommendation: |
  **Restrict PassRole permissions:** Never grant `iam:PassRole` with wildcards. Use resource-based conditions to limit which roles can be passed and to which services:

  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "iam:PassRole",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/approved-glue-roles-*",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "iam:PassedToService": "glue.amazonaws.com"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  **Implement SCPs to prevent privilege escalation:** Use Service Control Policies to deny PassRole on administrative roles to Glue services:

  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Action": "iam:PassRole",
    "Resource": [
      "arn:aws:iam::*:role/*admin*",
      "arn:aws:iam::*:role/*Admin*"
    ],
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "iam:PassedToService": "glue.amazonaws.com"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  **Monitor CloudTrail for Glue job and trigger creation:** Alert on `CreateJob` and `CreateTrigger` API calls, especially when:
  - Combined with PassRole on privileged roles
  - Triggers are created with `StartOnCreation=true`
  - Jobs use inline scripts or scripts from non-standard S3 locations
  - Execution intervals are suspiciously frequent (every minute)
  - Jobs are created by users who don't typically work with Glue

  **Restrict glue:CreateJob and glue:CreateTrigger permissions:** Only grant these permissions to users who legitimately need to create ETL workflows (data engineers). This is particularly important for trigger creation, which enables persistence.

  **Limit trigger scheduling frequencies:** Implement organizational policies or SCPs that prevent creation of triggers with very frequent schedules (e.g., every minute), as these are often indicators of abuse rather than legitimate ETL workflows.

  **Monitor IAM policy changes from Glue service principal:** Set up CloudWatch alarms for IAM policy modifications (`AttachUserPolicy`, `AttachRolePolicy`, `PutUserPolicy`, `PutRolePolicy`) where the source is the Glue service principal. This can indicate abuse of Glue jobs for privilege escalation.

  **Use IAM Access Analyzer:** Enable IAM Access Analyzer to automatically detect privilege escalation paths involving PassRole and Glue services. Review findings regularly and remediate identified risks.

  **Implement least privilege for Glue roles:** When creating IAM roles for Glue services, grant only the minimum permissions required for the specific ETL tasks. Avoid using administrative policies like `AdministratorAccess`. Typical Glue jobs need S3, Glue Data Catalog, and CloudWatch Logs access—not IAM permissions.
