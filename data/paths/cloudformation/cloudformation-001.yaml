description: A principal with `iam:PassRole` and `cloudformation:CreateStack` can
  launch a CloudFormation template that creates AWS resources. The template executes
  with the permissions of the passed IAM role. This allows creation of resources controlled
  by the attacker, such as IAM users, Lambda functions, or EC2 instances. The level
  of access gained depends on the permissions of the available roles.
prerequisites:
  admin:
  - A role must exist that trusts cloudformation.amazonaws.com to assume it
  - The role must have administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess)
  lateral:
  - A role must exist that trusts cloudformation.amazonaws.com to assume it

    description: Use the elevated privileges of the created resources
recommendation: "High powered service roles + overly permissive `iam:PassRole` is\
  \ what makes this privilege escalation path exploitable and impactful.\n\n- **Avoid\
  \ administrative service roles** - Very rarely does a CloudFormation stack need\
  \ administrative access. Use the principle of least privilege.\n- **Avoid granting\
  \ `iam:PassRole` on all resources** - Whenever possible, restrict `iam:PassRole`\
  \ to specific roles or specific services.\n\nUse IAM policy conditions to restrict\
  \ which roles can be passed and to which services:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Effect\":\
  \ \"Allow\",\n  \"Action\": \"iam:PassRole\",\n  \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/SpecificCloudFormationRole\"\
  ,\n  \"Condition\": {\n    \"StringEquals\": {\n      \"iam:PassedToService\": \"\
  cloudformation.amazonaws.com\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- Monitor CloudTrail for unusual\
  \ CloudFormation stack creation followed by immediate resource creation\n- Monitor\
  \ CloudTrail for stack creation by principals who do not usually create stacks\n\
  - Monitor CloudTrail for roles being passed to CloudFormation that haven't been\
  \ used before\n- Monitor and alert on CloudFormation stack creation with privileged\
  \ roles\n- Regularly audit CloudFormation stacks for excessive IAM permissions\n\
  - Regularly audit all IAM roles that trust the CloudFormation service and down-scope\
  \ any roles with administrative access\n"
limitations: 'This path provides administrative access only if the passed role has
  administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess or an equivalent custom policy).
  If only limited roles are available, you gain access limited to those permissions.
  However, even limited access may enable multi-hop attacks or access to sensitive
  data.
