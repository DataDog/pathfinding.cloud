description: A principal with `cloudformation:UpdateStack` can modify an existing
  CloudFormation stack that has an administrative service role attached. CloudFormation
  stacks execute with the permissions of their service role, which often requires
  elevated privileges to manage infrastructure. By updating the stack template to
  include new IAM resources (such as an admin role with a trust policy allowing the
  attacker to assume it), the attacker can leverage the stack's elevated permissions
  to create resources they couldn't create directly. This is particularly insidious
  because it appears as legitimate infrastructure management activity.
prerequisites:
  admin:
  - A CloudFormation stack must exist with an administrative service role (e.g., AdministratorAccess
    or an equivalent custom policy)
  - The principal must have permission to update that specific stack
  lateral:
  - A CloudFormation stack must exist with a service role that has elevated permissions
  - The principal must have permission to update that specific stack

    description: Verify administrator access
recommendation: "Restrict the `cloudformation:UpdateStack` permission using the principle\
  \ of least privilege.\n\nUse IAM policy conditions to restrict which stacks can\
  \ be updated:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n  \"Action\": \"cloudformation:UpdateStack\"\
  ,\n  \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:cloudformation:*:*:stack/approved-stack-name/*\",\n\
  \  \"Condition\": {\n    \"StringEquals\": {\n      \"cloudformation:StackId\":\
  \ \"arn:aws:cloudformation:*:*:stack/approved-stack/*\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\
  Additional controls:\n- Implement least privilege principles for CloudFormation\
  \ service roles - avoid granting AdministratorAccess when more granular permissions\
  \ suffice\n- Use CloudFormation stack policies to prevent modifications to sensitive\
  \ resources:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"Statement\": [\n      {\n        \"Effect\"\
  : \"Deny\",\n        \"Principal\": \"*\",\n        \"Action\": \"Update:*\",\n\
  \        \"Resource\": \"LogicalResourceId/SensitiveRole\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\
  \  ```\n- Implement Service Control Policies (SCPs) to restrict CloudFormation stack\
  \ updates that create or modify IAM resources\n- Monitor CloudTrail for `UpdateStack`\
  \ API calls, especially those that modify stacks with elevated service roles\n-\
  \ Enable CloudFormation drift detection and alerts to identify unauthorized stack\
  \ modifications\n- Require MFA for CloudFormation updates using condition keys like\
  \ `aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent`\n- Use IAM Access Analyzer to identify and remediate\
  \ privilege escalation paths involving CloudFormation permissions\n- Implement change\
  \ approval workflows for CloudFormation stack updates that modify IAM resources\n\
  - Regularly audit CloudFormation service roles and reduce permissions to the minimum\
  \ required for stack operations\n"
limitations: 'This path provides administrative access only if the existing stack''s
  service role has administrative permissions. If the service role has limited permissions,
  the attacker gains access limited to those permissions. However, even limited access
  may enable multi-hop attacks.
