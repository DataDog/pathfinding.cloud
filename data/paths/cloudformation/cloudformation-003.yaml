description: A principal with `iam:PassRole`, `cloudformation:CreateStackSet`, and `cloudformation:CreateStackInstances` can escalate privileges by creating a CloudFormation StackSet with a privileged execution role and then deploying stack instances to execute the malicious template. CloudFormation StackSets use a two-step process - `CreateStackSet` defines the template and configuration but does not actually deploy any resources, while `CreateStackInstances` deploys the StackSet to specific target accounts and regions, which triggers the actual resource creation. Both permissions are required for the attack - without `CreateStackInstances`, the StackSet remains just a definition and no malicious resources are created. StackSets use two roles - an administration role (used by the CloudFormation service) and an execution role (used to perform the actual resource creation in each target account). When an attacker passes a privileged execution role and deploys stack instances, they gain the ability to create any AWS resources that execution role has permissions for by defining those resources in the template. This commonly includes IAM resources such as roles with elevated permissions and trust policies allowing the attacker to assume them, effectively enabling the attacker to inherit the execution role's privileges and gain administrative access to the target accounts.

prerequisites:
  admin:
    - A privileged IAM role must exist that can be passed as a StackSet execution role
    - The execution role must have administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess or an equivalent custom policy)
    - An administration role must exist that trusts cloudformation.amazonaws.com and has permissions to assume the execution role
  lateral:
    - A privileged IAM role must exist that can be passed as a StackSet execution role
    - The execution role must have elevated permissions to create the desired resources
    - An administration role must exist for StackSet operations

recommendation: |
  Restrict access to `iam:PassRole` using the principle of least privilege. Use resource-based conditions to limit which roles can be passed and to which services:

  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "iam:PassRole",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/approved-stackset-execution-roles/*",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "iam:PassedToService": "cloudformation.amazonaws.com"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Restrict `cloudformation:CreateStackSet` and `cloudformation:CreateStackInstances` permissions to only authorized infrastructure automation principals. These are powerful permissions that should be tightly controlled.

  Apply IAM permission boundaries to StackSet execution roles to limit what resources they can create, even with administrative policies attached:

  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": [
        "iam:CreateRole",
        "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
        "iam:PutRolePolicy",
        "iam:CreateUser",
        "iam:CreateAccessKey"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }]
  }
  ```

  Use Service Control Policies (SCPs) to prevent StackSet execution roles from creating sensitive resources. Monitor CloudTrail for `CreateStackSet`, `CreateStackInstances`, and `PassRole` API calls, especially when templates contain IAM resources.

  Consider using CloudFormation service-managed StackSets with AWS Organizations, which provide more controlled permission models than self-managed StackSets. Implement change approval workflows for StackSet deployments.

  Enable MFA requirements for sensitive CloudFormation operations using IAM condition keys like `aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent`. Use AWS IAM Access Analyzer to identify roles with overly permissive PassRole capabilities.

  Regularly audit StackSet execution roles and their permission boundaries to ensure they follow least privilege principles. Review CloudFormation templates for suspicious IAM resource definitions before deployment.

limitations: |
  This path provides administrative access only if the passed execution role has administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess policy). If only limited roles are available, you gain access limited to those permissions. However, even limited access may enable multi-hop attacks or access to sensitive data. The execution role must also have permissions to create IAM resources if privilege escalation through IAM is the goal.

The StackSet is configured with both an administration role (used by the CloudFormation service to manage the StackSet) and an execution role (used to create resources in target accounts). The attacker controls the template content, allowing them to define any AWS resources that the execution role has permissions to create.

        The privileged IAM role passed to the StackSet as the execution role. This role must exist in the target account(s) and is used by CloudFormation to create the resources defined in the template. The role's permissions determine what resources can be created and thus the extent of privilege escalation possible.

        Stack instances are deployed from the StackSet to target accounts and regions using `cloudformation:CreateStackInstances`. Each stack instance provisions the resources defined in the template using the execution role's permissions. The attacker can deploy to multiple accounts and regions simultaneously, multiplying the impact of the attack.

        Command to create stack instances:

        The CloudFormation template executes in the target account(s) with the execution role's permissions. Common resources for privilege escalation include:
        - IAM roles with trust policies allowing the attacker to assume them
        - IAM users with access keys for the attacker
        - Lambda functions that execute privileged actions
        - IAM policies that grant elevated permissions to the starting principal
        - EC2 instances with User Data scripts that exfiltrate credentials

        If the execution role has administrative permissions (AdministratorAccess or equivalent), the template successfully creates resources that grant the attacker full administrative access to the target account(s).

        If the execution role has some elevated permissions but not full admin, the template creates resources that grant partial privilege escalation. This could include access to sensitive data (S3, RDS, DynamoDB), security configuration changes, or resources that enable additional privilege escalation paths.
