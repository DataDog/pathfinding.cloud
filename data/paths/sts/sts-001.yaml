description: A principal with `sts:AssumeRole` permission can assume IAM roles that trust them in their trust policy. We refer to this as two-way trust, or bidirectional trust. Direction 1 is the forward trust - the starting principal that has `sts:AssumeRole` permission on one or more roles. Direction 2 is the reverse trust - the target role must trust the starting principal to assume it. It's important to remember that if the target role trusts the account `root`, like this `arn:aws:iam::012345678901:root`, this trust extends to all principals in the account and satisfies direction 2. If this bidirectional trust is in place, the starting principal can assume the target role gain access to any elevated permissions by assuming the target role. However there is an edge case, noted in the prerequisites below. If the target role's trust policy trusts the starting principal explicitly, e.g, `arn:aws:iam::012345678901:user/startUser`, and that principal is in the same account as the target role, that principal does not need `sts:AssumeRole` permission. They just can assume the  role without any permissions.  
prerequisites:
  admin:
  - A role must exist with administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess)
  - The role's trust policy must allow the attacker's principal (user/role) to assume it
  -  If the role trusts the account root, e.g., `arn:aws:iam::012345678901:root`, any principal with `sts:AssumeRole` permission on the target role can assume it
  - If the role trusts the starting principal explicitly, e.g, `arn:aws:iam::012345678901:user/startUser`, and that principal is in the same account as the target role, that principal does not need `sts:AssumeRole` permission. They just can assume the  role without any permissions.t as the target role, that principal does not need `sts:AssumeRole` permission. They just can assume the  role without any permissions.  
  lateral:
  - The role's trust policy must allow the attacker's principal (user/role) to assume it
  - If the role trusts the account root, e.g., `arn:aws:iam::012345678901:root`, any principal with `sts:AssumeRole` permission on the target role can assume it
  - If the role trusts the starting principal explicitly, e.g, `arn:aws:iam::012345678901:user/startUser`, and that principal is in the same account as the target role, that principal does not need `sts:AssumeRole` permission. They just can assume the  role without any permissions.

recommendation: |
  - Avoiding using the account root notation (`arn:aws:iam::012345678901:root`) for internal accounts. This is fine to use with external accounts along with the externalID field, but is almost always overly permissive when used for internal AWS accounts. 
  - Only allow trusted principals to assume sensitive roles. Use conditions when possible.  

  Example restrictive trust policy:
  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/SpecificTrustedRole"
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
        "Condition": {          
          "IpAddress": {
            "aws:SourceIp": "1.2.3.0/24"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  Additional controls:
  - **Require MFA**: Require MFA for sensitive role assumptions using `aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent` condition
  - **Use External IDs**: Use external IDs for third-party cross-account role assumptions to prevent confused deputy attacks
  - **IP Address Restrictions**: Implement IP address restrictions in trust policies using `aws:SourceIp` condition when possible. 
  - **Session Policies**: Implement session policies to limit permissions even when assuming privileged roles, providing an additional layer of defense
  - **Monitor CloudTrail**: Alert on `AssumeRole` events on privileged roles, especially from unexpected principals
  - **Alert on Patterns**: Alert on unusual assume-role patterns or assumptions from unexpected IP addresses

permissions:
  required:
  - permission: sts:AssumeRole
    resourceConstraints: Target role ARN must be in the Resource section and the role's trust policy must allow the principal
      to assume it
  additional:
  - permission: iam:ListRoles
    resourceConstraints: Helpful for discovering available roles to assume
  - permission: iam:GetRole
    resourceConstraints: Useful for viewing role trust policies and attached permissions
