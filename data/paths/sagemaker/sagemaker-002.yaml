description: A principal with `iam:PassRole` and `sagemaker:CreateTrainingJob` can create a SageMaker training job with a privileged execution role. Training jobs can execute arbitrary container code and access AWS APIs with the permissions of the attached IAM role. By creating a training job with a malicious training script or container, the attacker can execute code with elevated privileges and exfiltrate credentials or modify AWS resources.
prerequisites:
  admin:
  - A role must exist that trusts sagemaker.amazonaws.com to assume it
  - The role must have administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess)
  - An S3 bucket must be accessible to store training data and output

recommendation: |
  High powered service roles + overly permissive `iam:PassRole` is what makes this privilege escalation path exploitable and impactful.

  - **Avoid administrative service roles** - Very rarely does a SageMaker training job need administrative access. Use the principle of least privilege.
  - **Avoid granting `iam:PassRole` on all resources** - Whenever possible, restrict `iam:PassRole` to specific roles or specific services.

  Use IAM policy conditions to restrict which roles can be passed and to which services:

  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "iam:PassRole",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/SpecificSageMakerRole",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "iam:PassedToService": "sagemaker.amazonaws.com"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  - Monitor CloudTrail for unusual SageMaker training job creation followed by immediate execution
  - Monitor CloudTrail for training job creation by principals who do not usually create training jobs
  - Monitor CloudTrail for roles being passed to SageMaker that haven't been used before
  - Monitor and alert on SageMaker training job creation with privileged roles
  - Regularly audit SageMaker training jobs for excessive IAM permissions
  - Regularly audit all IAM roles that trust the SageMaker service and down-scope any roles with administrative access
limitations: 'This path provides administrative access only if the passed role has administrative permissions (e.g., AdministratorAccess or an equivalent custom policy). If only limited roles are available, you gain access limited to those permissions. However, even limited access may enable multi-hop attacks or access to sensitive data.

      The attacker creates a new SageMaker training job and passes a privileged role to it. The training job is configured with a malicious training script (uploaded to S3) or a custom container image that will execute code to escalate privileges.

      Commands:
      ```bash
      # Create malicious training script
      echo '#!/bin/bash
      aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name attacker --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess
      ' > exploit.sh && chmod +x exploit.sh

      # Upload to S3
      aws s3 cp exploit.sh s3://BUCKET_NAME/exploit/exploit.sh

      # Create training job with privileged role
